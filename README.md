# RLCraft-2.9.3v-Manhunt
HOW TO INSTALL:

Download this zip, go to your RLCraft insall location and unzip it inside the main RLCraft directory. Then you need to agree on every asked overwrite to make this work correctly. You should make a new 2.9.3 RLCraft profile for this.


Summary:
The goal of this is to recreate Manhunt Gamemode into RLCraft with changes focusing on making the whole speedrunning process faster.
 
Features:

# Lycanites
Underground cave lycanite mob spawn rates have been greatly reduced. (Doesn't include being in darkness)

Nether lycanite mob spawn rates have been reduced greatly.

End lycanite mob spawn rates have been reduced greatly.


# Waystones
Warp scroll use time is increased from 1.6 seconds to 6.3 seconds.

ANY waystone cost is now 10 lvls.


# First Aid
Each body part now has 6 hearts instead of RLCrafts default 3 hearts.

# Other Changes
Spawn radius is set from 20000 to 2500.

Expierience gain multiplier is now 3x on top of RLCrafts 2x. So 6x more from vanilla.


# Added Mods
Morpheus (sleeping mod)

RLCraft Manhunt (hunters and runners with little game logic)

Amphithere Mod (adds stamina to amphitheres)

Savemystronghold (to save strongholds)

# Some Important Things
All players on first join get teleported to 0 0 location.

How the game starts is agreed upon the people playing. Because like I'm not coding that in lol.

If a runner dies then they get turned into a hunter.

Runners have one life and their goal is to kill the Ender Dragon.

Hunters have unlimited lives and their goal is to kill all the runners so they can't kill the Ender Dragon.


Hunters are equiped with a compass that will track any runner that they choose.

They can switch between targets by Shift-Right-Clicking the compass while holding in hand.

After that the compass will always track the location of that player.
